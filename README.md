# MasterTherm Homekit

MasterTherm heatpump Homekit Accessory for Particle Photon.

Goal of this project is to connect MasterTherm heatpumps with Apple Homekit. Basic idea is to use a Particle Photon to create a bridge between MasterTherm cloud and Homekit.

A Homekit termostat accessory is created.

Pairing code for Homekit: TODO.

Installation and Usage:

1. Get a Particle Photon from https://store.particle.io
2. Clone this repo.
3. Project is created in Visual Studio Code. Use VS Code to compile/flash/run.
4. Use Particle Console to setup credentials to Particle Cloud.

Feel free to contact me.
